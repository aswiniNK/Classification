    "<b> Ans : </b> We could use the score/rating. A rating of 4 or 5 could be considered a positive review. A review of 1 or 2 could be considered as negative. A review of 3 is ignored by considering it as neutral. This is an approxiamate and proxy way of determining the polarity (positive/negative) of a review.\n",
